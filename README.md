Dotfiles for WSL, made by rabbits!

This is my personal ever-changing dotfiles repo, feel free to pick
up anything you think might be useful to you.

Some of the stuff I use:
 - fzf
 - git
 - jetbrains IDE
 - mintty
 - neovim
 - nodejs
 - pandoc
 - surfingkeys
 - tmux
 - zsh

To bootstrap all the symlinks simply run the `install.sh` script and get some coffee.
