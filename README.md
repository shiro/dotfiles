# dotfiles
My dotfiles, made by rabbits!

This is my personal ever-changing dotfiles repo, feel free to pick
up anything you think might be useful to you.

Some of the stuff I use:
- fzf (fuzzy finder)
- git
- jetbrains IDE
- st (terminal emulator)
- neovim (file editor)
- pandoc
- surfingkeys (chromium browser extension)
- tmux (terminal multiplexer)
- zsh (shell)

## Install

To list all options simply run the main script:
```
./dot
````
and use the interactive menu.
